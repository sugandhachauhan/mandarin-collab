# A checklist for making software in this repo FAIR

- [ ] Write a better README file. Look for suggestions on what to include in [fair-code.](https://github.com/manuGil/fair-code)
- [ ] Provide  a **CONTRIBUTING.md** file with contribution guidelines. You can use [this template to make one](https://github.com/manuGil/fair-code/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this repository
- [ ] Clean the source source code in the `src/` directory. Broken code might be commented out, or old and unused code might still be there.
- [ ] Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, function and classes in the source code.
- [ ] Include unit-tests. Learn about [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html)  and write a unit-test for the function `division()` in `operations.py`
- [ ] Include a [CITATION](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) file.
